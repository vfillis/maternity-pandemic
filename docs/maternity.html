  <p>FXXX babies have been born between March and August in England - born in the middle of a global pandemic. How have midwives, parents and charities experienced England's maternity services?   </p>
  </div>
  <p>Nervous chatter fills the ward, mixed with the sound of bouncing birthing balls.</p>
  <p>XX/hospital: XX pregnant women in induced labour, sitting on birthing balls in the middle of the ward, chatting to each other. Among them is Jocelyn Ringer, 29-years old. It is May 2020, two months into the coronavirus pandemic, when Jocelyn is giving birth to her first baby.</p>
  <p>When she found out she was pregnant nine months before, she had no idea her birthing experience would be characterised by social distancing, face masks and hospital visiting policies.</p>
  <p>The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has impacted maternity services across England. To reduce the risk of spreading the virus, maternity services have been restricting the number of people attending the services since March.</p> 
  <p>In many NHS trusts women like Jocelyn aren't allowed any visitors during the induction, after the birth on the postnatal ward or during antenatal appointments and scans.</p>
  <p>"While other areas of the health service can postpone and cancel procedures, there is still an ongoing need for maternity services," Gill Walton, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Midwives says.</p>
  <p>Women are still pregnant. Women are still having babies. The pandemic doesn't change that.</p>
  <p>363,209 babies have been born between March and September in England and Wales - in the middle of a global pandemic. According to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/provisionalbirthsinenglandandwales">new data published by the National Office for Statistics (ONS)</a> 153,464 live births occurred between April and June, the period of the strictest lockdown measures in England and Wales.</p>

  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4586744"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  <p>96 Percent of live births between January and September 2020 happened in NHS establishments such as NHS hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings.</p>

  <h3>From face-to-face to over the phone</h3>    
  <p>Most of Jocelyn's appointments and scans took place before the pandemic. Her 26-week appointment was the last one that took place in hospital with her husband present. Her 34-week appointment was over the phone.</p>
  <p>"I went back in for my 36-week appointment. This was when they realised I had pre-eclampsia. Meanwhile, my husband had to wait in the car," Jocelyn says.</p>
  <p>Situations like these are why doulas from the Birthbliss Academy have started the #ButNotMaternity campaign. One of them is Abbi Leibert, doula and campaign manager.</p>
  <p>The aim of the campaign is to support parents and birth-workers through maternity Covid-19 restrictions on induction, postnatal and labours wards as well as during antenatal care.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">"Those scans can be great news in which case the partners should be sharing that joy.

  <p><b>Sam Nightingale</b>, a midwife working in an antenatal clinic, witnesses the impacts on women coming in without their partner for appointments.</p>
  <p>Having to make decisions without their partners present is difficult for many. "But there usually is time for follow-up appointments, so the women can come back after having discussed that information with a partner," Sam Nightingale says.</p>
