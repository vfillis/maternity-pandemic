  <p>FXXX babies have been born between March and August in England - born in the middle of a global pandemic. How have midwives, parents and charities experienced England's maternity services?   </p>
  </div>
  <p>Nervous chatter fills the ward, mixed with the sound of bouncing birthing balls.</p>
  <p>XX pregnant women in induced labour, are sitting on birthing balls in the middle of the ward, chatting to each other. Among them is Jocelyn Ringer, 29-years old. It is May 2020, two months into the coronavirus pandemic, when Jocelyn gave birth to her first baby.</p>
  <p>When she found out she was pregnant nine months before, she had no idea her birthing experience would be characterised by social distancing, face masks and hospital visiting policies.</p>
  <p>The coronavirus pandemic has impacted maternity services across England. To reduce the risk of spreading the virus, maternity services have been restricting the number of people attending/visiting the hospitals/services since March. In many NHS trusts women like Jocelyn aren't allowed any visitors during the induction, after the birth on the postnatal ward or during antenatal appointments and scans.</p>
  <p>"While other areas of the health service can postpone and cancel procedures, there is still an ongoing need for maternity services," Gill Walton, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Midwives says.</p>
  <p>Women are still pregnant. Women are still having babies. The pandemic doesn't change that. More than ever, they need the support and care of maternity services.</p>
  <p>XXX babies have been born between March and August in England, born in the middle of a global pandemic. These figures have been published by the NHS. The actual number of births is higher because not all births are being reported to the NHS.</p>
