  <p>FXXX babies have been born between March and August in England &mdash; born in the middle of a global pandemic. How have midwives, parents and charities experienced England's maternity services?   </p>
  </div>
  <p>Nervous chatter fills the ward, mixed with the sound of bouncing birthing balls.</p>
  <p>XX/hospital: XX pregnant women in induced labour, sitting on birthing balls in the middle of the ward, chatting to each other. Among them is <b>Jocelyn Ringer</b>, 29-years old. It is May 2020, two months into the coronavirus pandemic, when Jocelyn is giving birth to her first baby.</p>
  <p>When she found out she was pregnant nine months before, she had no idea her birthing experience would be characterised by social distancing, face masks and hospital visiting policies.</p>
  <p>The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has impacted maternity services across England. To reduce the risk of spreading the virus, maternity services have been restricting the number of people attending the services since March.</p> 
  <p>In many NHS trusts women like Jocelyn aren't allowed any visitors during the induction, after the birth on the postnatal ward or during antenatal appointments and scans.</p>
  <p>"While other areas of the health service can postpone and cancel procedures, there is still an ongoing need for maternity services," <b>Gill Walton</b>, Chief Executive of the <b>Royal College of Midwives</b> says.</p>
  <p>Women are still pregnant. Women are still having babies. The pandemic doesn't change that.</p>
  <p>363,209 babies have been born between March and September in England and Wales &mdash; in the middle of a global pandemic. According to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/provisionalbirthsinenglandandwales">new data published by the National Office for Statistics (ONS)</a> 153,464 live births occurred between April and June, the period of the strictest lockdown measures in England and Wales.</p>

  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4586744"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  <p>96 Percent of live births between January and September 2020 happened in NHS establishments such as NHS hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings.</p>

  <h3>From face-to-face to over the phone</h3>    
  <p>Most of Jocelyn's appointments and scans took place before the pandemic. Her 26-week appointment was the last one that took place in hospital with her husband present. Her 34-week appointment was over the phone.</p>
  <p>"I went back in for my 36-week appointment. This was when they realised I had pre-eclampsia. Meanwhile, my husband had to wait in the car," Jocelyn says.</p>
  <p>Situations like these are why doulas from the <b>Birthbliss Academy</b> have started the <b>#ButNotMaternity</b> campaign. One of them is <b>Abbi Leibert</b>, doula and campaign manager.</p>
  <p>The aim of the campaign is to support parents and birth-workers through maternity Covid-19 restrictions on induction, postnatal and labours wards as well as during antenatal care.</p>

font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A post shared by But Not Maternity (@butnotmaternity)</a></p></div></blockquote> <script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>
 
  <p>Abbi believes, women should not be alone at appointments when they find out news &mdash; good or bad &mdash; about their baby.</p>
  <blockquote class="quote">"Those scans can be great news in which case the partners should be sharing that joy. And if it's bad news, then the partners should definitely be there, not just to hear the news, but to support their partner. It's not something people should have to find out about on their own." <br><div class="source">Abbi Leibert</div></blockquote>
  
  <p><b>Sam Nightingale</b>, a midwife working in an antenatal clinic, witnesses the impacts on women coming in without their partner for appointments.</p>
  <p>Having to make decisions without their partners present is difficult for many. "But there usually is time for follow-up appointments, so the women can come back after having discussed that information with a partner," Sam Nightingale says.</p>
  
  <h3>Increasing support between women</h3>
  <p>Prior to covid, women on the labour ward would often close the curtains around their bed, creating their own private space with their partner behind curtains.</p>
  <p>"There wasn't much communication and rapport between different women on the ward", midwife Sam Nightingale says.</p>
  <p>Now, she sees increasing support between the women on the ward. Without the partners being there, curtains are staying open, women are talking to each other, supporting each other. Sometimes it is something as little as helping a woman who had a caesarian section to reach a drink.</p>
  <p>"That's one positive thing that we have seen out of the change in the visiting policy," Sam Nightingale says.</p>
  <p>Still, she is convinced that women would rather have their partners there, although they have enjoyed some of the benefits of other men not being around.</p>
  <blockquote class="quote">"It's a really difficult balance, but I think there are situations where women find it difficult that in quite a vulnerable time after they've had a baby there are so many unknown men around."<br><div class="source">Sam Nightingale</div></blockquote>
  
  <h3>"Everyone needs support at the moment"</h3>
  <p>A crucial part of the #ButNotMaternity campaign is being there for parents, offering support.</p>
  <p>Every day, Abbi is getting messages from concerned parents. Although she wants nothing more than being able to give an instant answer that would fix things, it's not that easy.</p>
  <p>But taking five minutes to send a voice message, offering support and help, is sometimes all the parents need. "They just need/want somebody who is not freaking out on the other end of the phone. Someone who is calm and just talks them through things," Abbi says.</p>
  <p>With a number of different charities and organisations being involved in the campaign, parents can be sign-posted to a range of different services.</p>
  <p>While <b>Birthrights</b> offers legal support, the <b>Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services (AIMS)</b> is focussed on practical support. <b>The Birth Trauma Association</b> and <b>Make Birth Better</b> help women with their mental health if they have had a traumatic experience in the past.</p>
  <blockquote class="quote">"Everybody is struggling at the moment and everyone needs support. It's important to just be there for each other. We are just helping wherever we can rather than hinder."<br><div class="source">Abbi Leibert</div></blockquote>
    
  <h3>Uncertainty during the pregnancy</h3>
  <p>During the pregnancy, Jocelyn was very uncertain as nobody really knew what was going on and what the situation would be like on her due date.</p>  
  <p>"I had signed up to do hypnobirthing as I was nervous about birth, but all antenatal classes got cancelled", she says.</p>
  <p> more about feeling during the pregnancy </p>
  <p>From 13 March she had to stay home .. (look at email again) Instead of going to/attending these classes, she stayed at home with Google and midwives on Instagram as her source of information.</p>
  <p>Staying informed is also what Abbi advices women: "It makes a massive difference to your stress levels just to know what's going on rather than just reading headlines and thinking that the worst is always going to happen."</p>
  
  <h3>NHS guidelines</h3>
  <p>… new NHS guidelines…</p>
  <p>Abbi Leibert critises the NHS guidelines for being ambiguous. "Although they are guidelines NHS trusts don't have to implement them."</p>
  <p>As a result, the policies and rules regarding visitors and birthing partners vary from trust to trust.</p>
  <p>xxx collect data from each trust... / taking a closer look at NHS trusts and how they have adapted to the pandemic.</p>
  <p>Some NHS trusts have found ways to avoid crowded waiting rooms and allowing partners coming in for scans.</p>
  <p>"The women and their partners have to wait in the car park until they get a text message when it's their turn to come up. This way, no one is waiting inside. This is working really well in quite a lot of hospitals, but it obviously takes a bit more time," Abbi says.</p>
  <p>If, for example, the car park and the sonography department are far away from each other, it does not work as well. ("they won't be able to get through enough people and that just needs to be explained.")</p>
  <p>In the next weeks, #ButNotMaternity will take a closer look trusts who have kept their restrictions minimal throughout the whole of lockdown to write case studies and best practices.</p>
  <blockquote class="quote">"We hope that the information will be shared within the truts. While I think some trusts don't have the ability to implement these things because of staffing and budget, some of them might have just not thought of those ways to do it"<br><div class="source">Abbi Leibert</div></blockquote>
